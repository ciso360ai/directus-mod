# Cloud Exclusives

Some features are only available to Directus Cloud (and Enterprise Self-Hosted) projects, and are not available in the
open source Directus Core project.

These features offer extra functionality, rather than core features which will remain open source and will be actively
developed.

Cloud Exclusives development, deployment, and updates are managed by the Directus team, so these will stay up to date
with the [latest version of Directus](/cloud/glossary.html#automatic-updates).
